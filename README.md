# New-World---server-status-bot--discord-
This is a stripped down version of the Marauder Bot I coded for the bifrost server. It will update (every 180 seonds) the status of a particular world on new world.

The code is pretty simple and can be added in to any existing bot. I have omitted any of the more custom commands/functions of the Marauder bot as they are generally
server specific and most people will be more interested in the world update function anyway.

Your bot needs to have admin permissions as well as intent privileges.

To set up just edit the config.py file with all of the information to make the bot work.

Docker File : (coming soon)

If you want to view the output on Docker you need to use unbuffered output

CMD ["python","-u","main.py"]
